## Ransomware Simulator (Academic Project) :

A safe, controlled ransomware behavior simulation for cybersecurity education.

This project demonstrates how real ransomware behaves at a conceptual level—including file discovery, simulated encryption, file renaming, access blocking, and warning messages.

It is designed strictly for learning and research, with all harmful logic removed.




##🧩 Design Flow :

The high-level simulation flow of the ransomware simulator is documented here: 

[Design Flow](DESIGN_FLOW.md)




## Safety Notice :

This project is an educational simulation.
It does NOT include:

Real ransomware code

Real encryption algorithms

Harmful or deployable malware behavior

Any destructive capabilities

Only safe pseudo-code, diagrams, and behavioral modeling are included.



## Project Goals :

This project aims to provide an academic understanding of:

How ransomware locates and processes files

How XOR-based encryption works (simulated safely)

How ransomware renames files (example: .locked)

How malware blocks access and shows warning messages

How Windows API functions can be used by malware

How to safely test malware behavior in isolated environments

How to develop secure coding habits

    

## Why This Project Matters :

Understanding ransomware behavior helps cybersecurity students:

Recognize early malware indicators

Improve detection and monitoring

Strengthen defensive system architecture

Learn attacker workflows from a safe perspective

Build better security controls and response plans



## 🛠 Technologies Used :

C Programming (Windows environment)

XOR-based transformation (safe simulation)

Windows API (FindFirstFile, FindNextFile, MessageBox)

File I/O and directory enumeration

Malware workflow modeling



## Learning Outcomes :

By working on this project, I learned:

How ransomware performs file scanning

How malware simulations operate safely

How to manipulate files and directories programmatically

How to simulate encryption behavior without harm

How to model real-world malware workflows

How to integrate security thinking into software design



Access to Academic Code :

The actual academic implementation (with sensitive parts removed) is not included in this public repository to ensure safety and compliance.

For legitimate academic review, a redacted version can be shared privately upon request.
