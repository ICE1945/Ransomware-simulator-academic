# Ransomware Simulator (Academic Project)

This project is a **safe, controlled ransomware simulator** developed for academic and cybersecurity learning purposes.  
It demonstrates how real ransomware behaves at a conceptual level — specifically in terms of:

- File discovery  
- Simple encryption logic  
- File renaming  
- User access prevention  
- Alert messaging  

⚠️ **This project does NOT contain harmful or deployable ransomware code.  
All real malicious logic has been removed for safety.**  
Only pseudo-code and structural explanations are provided.
