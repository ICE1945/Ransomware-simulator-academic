# Ransomware Simulator (Academic Project) :

This project is a **safe, controlled ransomware simulator** developed for academic and cybersecurity learning purposes.  
It demonstrates how real ransomware behaves at a conceptual level — specifically in terms of:

- File discovery  
- Simple encryption logic  
- File renaming  
- User access prevention  
- Alert messaging  

⚠️ **This project does NOT contain harmful or deployable ransomware code.  
All real malicious logic has been removed for safety.**  
Only pseudo-code and structural explanations are provided.

## 🎯 Project Goals :

- Understand how ransomware locates and processes files  
- Study encryption concepts (XOR-based simulation)  
- Explore malicious behavior patterns safely  
- Learn how Windows API functions work in malware simulations  
- Develop secure coding habits and safe testing practices

## 🧩 High-Level Architecture :


[Target Folder]
↓
[File Scanner] → finds files
↓
[Encryption Simulator] → transforms content
↓
[File Renamer] → adds .locked extension
↓
[Access Blocker] → Shows "file encrypted" warning
