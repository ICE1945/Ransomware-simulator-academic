## 🧩 What This Project Simulates

This project demonstrates the **behavior** of simple ransomware, including:

- Scanning a directory
- "Encrypting" files (simulated)
- Renaming files to `.locked`
- Blocking access with a warning popup

It focuses on malware *behavior*, not malware *execution capability*.
