## ⚠️ Safety Warning

This project is a **safe, controlled ransomware simulation** designed strictly for academic and cybersecurity learning purposes.

- No harmful or deployable ransomware logic is included  
- No real encryption is used  
- No destructive behavior exists  
- Safe pseudo-code replaces all malicious components  
- Built and tested only in isolated, non-production environments  

The purpose of this project is to understand malware behavior patterns so that stronger defensive architectures can be built.
